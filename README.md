# Local AI Fall Auditing Tool

 **A privacy-first AI nursing assistant that uses on-device LLMs to audit resident progress notes for falls.**

This tool runs entirely offline using [llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile) and the `Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct` model. It was built to help aged care nurses and quality teams quickly screen large volumes of progress notes for possible fall incidents — without sending any sensitive data to the cloud.

- A folder containing:
  - `llamafile-0.9.0.exe`

- Python 3.9 or later
- The following are standard Python libraries (no installation needed):
